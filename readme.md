# Derren Brown's 45 Table  
After i saw [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAJHUv2JS7w&) i was interested in how to create such table.
Probably there is some mathematical way to do it, but i wanted to give it a try first. 

# Approach
First i created the validation rules (pretty elementary stuff). 
Then i thought a brute force approach might work, but checking all permutations of a 4x4 array would take more than a life time. So i did a genetic algorithm search. 

# Results
I was able to calculate a lot of tables in a few minutes but i can definitely be optimized further.

### Note
The code was written in about two hours so it's a little bit messy!
